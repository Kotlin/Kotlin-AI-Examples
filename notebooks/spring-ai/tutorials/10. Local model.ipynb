    "\n",
    "- **Free to use** — no API costs or rate limits\n",
    "- **Work offline** — no internet connection required\n",

       "Alright, so I need to come up with a joke about Kotlin. Hmm, where do I start? Well, first, I should think about what makes Kotlin unique or special compared to other programming languages.\n",
       "\n",
       "I remember that Kotlin is often referred to as the \"Kotlin language\" but sometimes people jokingly call it \"Java's little brother.\" Maybe I can use that in a joke.\n",
       "\n",
       "Oh wait, there's also something about Kotlin being statically typed. That could be funny because of the way the word 'static' is used. Like maybe someone says they've been static for a while, meaning they're old or something. But that might not fit well.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, another angle: Kotlin is known for its syntax being similar to Java but with some improvements. So maybe I can compare it to something else in a funny way. For example, comparing it to a more complex system like an operating system.\n",
       "\n",
       "Oh! Maybe something about Kotlin being the OS of the future. That's a common phrase people use. So if someone says \"Kotlin is the next OS,\" that's already a joke because it's not meant to be used as an operating system but rather as a programming language.\n",
       "\n",
       "But maybe I can make it more punny or play on words. Let me try rephrasing that. How about, \"Why did the Kotlin project team go to the gym? Because they wanted to be 'OS ready'!\" That's a bit of a stretch, but I like how it plays on \"OS\" and \"be fit.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, another idea: since Kotlin has a modern syntax, maybe something about being too modern or complicated. But that might not be as funny.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, thinking about the features, like extension functions or coroutines. Maybe something about adding more features or being lightweight.\n",
       "\n",
       "Or perhaps playing on the fact that Kotlin's creator is Andrey Belyaev, which sounds Russian but could also be a pun on \"Aleksey Beliyev,\" which might not make sense. Hmm, maybe not the best angle.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, another approach: since Kotlin runs on JVM, maybe joke about it running on a specific type of server or being efficient in some way. But I think the OS reference is more straightforward and widely understandable.\n",
       "\n",
       "So putting it together, the joke could be: \"Why did the Kotlin programmer go to the gym? Because they wanted to be 'OS ready'!\" That's clear enough for someone who knows what an OS is—Operating System—but also a bit humorous because Kotlin isn't actually for operating systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "I think that works. It's simple, plays on words, and people get the reference without needing too much background knowledge.\n",

      "Alright, so I need to figure out how to create a colorful periodic table of Kotlin operators that shows their precedence levels with examples. Let me break down the task and see how I can approach it.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that a periodic table of operators typically lists each operator along with its precedence level. In this case, since it's for Kotlin, I should list all the relevant operators in order from highest to lowest precedence.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll start by outlining the structure of an HTML document. It needs to have html, head, and body tags. The head will include a title and some CSS styles. The body will contain the content, which is the periodic table itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to decide on the visual elements. Using tables makes sense because each operator can be a row with its precedence level and description. Maybe using a grid or table within the body could help organize the information neatly.\n",
      "\n",
      "For styling, I want it to look clean and readable. I'll use a sans-serif font for readability, set a background color that's light enough not to overwhelm the content, and add borders to each operator row for clarity. The operators can have different colors to make them stand out, perhaps using hex codes that represent different precedence levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should include an h1 title at the top to introduce the periodic table. Then, maybe an h2 or a section heading explaining the purpose of the table. Each row in the table will contain the operator symbol, its precedence level, and examples on either side for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples are crucial because they show how each operator is used in context. For instance, when using the increment operator (++), it's clear to use it as ++i or --i with an example like i++ + 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll need to list all Kotlin operators in order from highest to lowest precedence. This includes arithmetic operators, followed by comparison and logical operators, then bitwise operations, and so on. Each will be placed in the table with appropriate spacing and styling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Including a legend at the bottom of the table could help users understand which color corresponds to which precedence level. Using small colored squares or blocks with labels like \"High Precedence\" and \"Low Precedence\" can make this clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also need to ensure that the HTML is valid, so I'll check for proper tags, self-closing elements where necessary, and correct indentation for readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'll test the code in a browser to make sure everything displays correctly. If something doesn't look right, I might adjust the styling or the structure of the table.\n",
