    "\n",
    "- **Free to use** — no API costs or rate limits\n",

       "Okay, so I need to come up with a joke about Kotlin. Hmm, where do I start? Well, I know that Kotlin is a programming language, and it's often compared to Java because it runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). So maybe I can play around with that.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let me think about the differences between Java and Kotlin. One of the main selling points of Kotlin is that it's more modern and concise, which makes coding easier and less error-prone. There are also some features like null safety, which was a big issue in Java. Oh, right, in Java you can have nullable types with 'null' being allowed, but that can lead to NullPointerExceptions if not handled properly.\n",
       "\n",
       "In Kotlin, they introduced the concept of 'nullable' and 'non-nullable' variables using the '?' symbol. So, for example, a variable like String? would be nullable, meaning it could hold a String or null. But if you try to call a method on a null value, it will throw an exception automatically, which is called a NullPointerException but in Kotlin, it's more descriptive.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, so maybe I can make a joke about how Java has these issues with nulls and exceptions, while Kotlin handles them better. That could be funny because it's highlighting a problem in Java and showing that Kotlin makes things easier.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let me try to structure the joke. Maybe something like why don't Java developers argue with each other? Because they have so much in common... but then switch to Kotlin for the punchline. How about: \"Why don’t Java Developers argue with each other? They’ve got too much in common—like NullPointerExceptions! But wait, if you use Kotlin, those are a thing of the past!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "That makes sense because it starts by talking about Java's problem and then introduces Kotlin as the solution. The humor comes from the contrast between Java's issues and Kotlin's improvements.\n",
       "\n",
       "I should make sure that the joke is clear and not too technical for someone who isn't familiar with both languages. It needs to be relatable, so using terms like NullPointerExceptions is okay because they are a common pain point for Java developers.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another angle could be the syntax differences or other features, but I think focusing on null safety and exception handling is a strong point because it directly addresses a known issue and shows how Kotlin improves upon it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Maybe add a bit more flair to the punchline. Instead of just saying \"those are a thing of the past,\" perhaps something like \"Kotlin makes them a thing of the past.\" That emphasizes the benefit more.\n",
       "\n",
       "So putting it all together, the joke would be: \"Why don’t Java Developers argue with each other? They’ve got too much in common—like NullPointerExceptions! But if you use Kotlin, those are a thing of the past!\"\n",
       "\n",
