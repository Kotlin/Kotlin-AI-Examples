    "\n",
    "- **Free to use** â€” no API costs or rate limits\n",
    "- **Work offline** â€” no internet connection required\n",
    "- **Privacy** â€” process sensitive data without sending it to third parties\n",

      "Alright, so I need to create a colorful periodic table of Kotlin operators with precedence levels and examples. Let me break down how I approached this.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, understanding the user's requirements was key. They want an HTML5 document that's visually appealing, uses semantic tags, and includes operator precedence information along with examples. The structure should be clear, so using tables or lists makes sense for organizing the operators.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started by outlining the sections: a header, a table of operators with their precedence levels, descriptions, examples, and a note on associativity. Using semantic HTML tags like h1, h2, p, and ul will help with structure and SEO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I considered the styling. Minimalist CSS is important for readability. I decided on using a clean font, alternating row colors for clarity, and padding to make the table neat. Including a subtle shadow on the table adds depth without being distracting.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the operators themselves, each needs a precedence level. I listed them in descending order, starting from higher precedence. Each operator has a name, symbol, description, and an example. Examples are crucial so users can see how each operator works in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I chose to use a table structure because it's easy to organize data rows. Each row represents an operator category, with the first row being the highest precedence and others following. The 'Description' section uses a list for clarity, making it easier to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Styling considerations included setting a background color for the header to introduce the topic clearly. Operator symbols were colored differently based on their precedence levelâ€”higher levels in more vibrant colors like pink and purple, while lower ones are darker shades of gray. This visual hierarchy helps users quickly grasp the precedence without confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I made sure all elements were semantic, using h2 tags for categories like 'Description' and p tags for short explanations. Lists were used where necessary, such as in the example section, to present each operator's usage clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I ensured the HTML was valid by checking tags and structure. The meta tags were included for proper DOCTYPE declaration, which is essential for browser compatibility. The overall design is responsive, using padding and margins to enhance readability on different devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I structured the HTML with appropriate sections, applied a clean CSS style, and populated each part with the necessary information. This approach ensures that the periodic table of Kotlin operators is both informative and visually organized, meeting the user's requirements effectively.\n",
