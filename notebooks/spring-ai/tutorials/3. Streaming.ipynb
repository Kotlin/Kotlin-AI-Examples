    "# Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming is a capability that allows AI providers to deliver responses as tokens are generated in real-time,\n",
    "rather than waiting for the complete response to be finished.\n",
    "You can visualize it as filling a bucket with water — streaming lets you watch the water level rising in real-time,\n",
    "instead of placing the bucket somewhere, walking away, and only returning once it's completely full.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming significantly improves the user experience,\n",
    "as people can immediately see the response forming rather than staring at a loading indicator.\n",
    "This is especially valuable since synchronous requests can take quite a long time to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement streaming responses with Kotlin and Spring AI.\n",
    "For this, we'll need to add dependencies.\n",
    "In addition to `spring-ai-openai`, we'll need the Kotlin coroutines library to work with `Flow`."

One sunny morning, Benny discovered a sparkling, hidden path lined with colorful wildflowers that led deep into the Enchanted Forest. As he hopped along the path, he met a wise old tortoise named Tilly, who warned him of a mischievous fox lurking nearby, always on the lookout for a tasty rabbit snack. Undeterred, Benny continued on his adventure, determined to find the legendary Rainbow Carrot said to grant any wish to the one who found it. \n",

They danced and sang as they ventured deeper into the forest, unaware of the sly fox watching them from behind a tree. Suddenly, the fox sprang out, but quick-thinking Benny devised a clever plan, leading the fox on a wild chase through the twisting trees and over bubbling brooks. With the help of his new friends, Benny created a diversion that allowed them to escape safely, leaving the frustrated fox behind. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, after a long day of adventures, Benny and his friends reached the glimmering pond where the fabled Rainbow Carrot was said to grow. As the sun set, casting a golden glow over the water, Benny spotted the vibrant carrot emerging from the earth, and with a heart full of hope, he made his wish for peace and happiness for all the creatures of the meadow. From that day on, the meadow flourished, and Benny, the brave little rabbit, became a beloved hero, reminding everyone that true courage comes from friendship and kindness."

One day, while exploring a hidden glade, Ruby stumbled upon a shimmering pond that sparkled like diamonds under the sun. \n",

With their wishes granted, the three rabbits returned to their meadow, knowing that their friendship was the greatest magic of all.
