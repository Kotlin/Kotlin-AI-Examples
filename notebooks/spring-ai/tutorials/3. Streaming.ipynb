    "# Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming is a capability that allows AI providers to deliver responses as tokens are generated in real-time,\n",
    "rather than waiting for the complete response to be finished.\n",
    "You can visualize it as filling a bucket with water — streaming lets you watch the water level rising in real-time,\n",
    "instead of placing the bucket somewhere, walking away, and only returning once it's completely full.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming significantly improves the user experience,\n",
    "as people can immediately see the response forming rather than staring at a loading indicator.\n",
    "This is especially valuable since synchronous requests can take quite a long time to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement streaming responses with Kotlin and Spring AI.\n",
    "For this, we'll need to add dependencies.\n",
    "In addition to `spring-ai-openai`, we'll need the Kotlin coroutines library to work with `Flow`."
