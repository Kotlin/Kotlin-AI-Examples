    "# Evaluator-Optimizer Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll dive into the evaluator-optimizer pattern â€” a powerful feedback loop approach for AI systems.\n",
    "Using Kotlin and Claude via LangChain4j,\n",
    "we'll implement a practical example that shows how to create AI agents that can continuously improve through self-evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the evaluator-optimizer pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluator-optimizer pattern creates a feedback loop where:\n",
    "1. One LLM generates a response (the optimizer)\n",
    "2. Another LLM evaluates that response against specific criteria (the evaluator)\n",
    "3. The feedback is used to create an improved response\n",
    "4. This cycle continues until the response meets quality standards\n",
    "\n",
    "![Evaluator-Optimizer Workflow Diagram](image/evaluator_optimizer.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach mimics how humans refine their work through iteration and feedback,\n",
    "creating a system that can self-improve over multiple attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use this pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code generation with specific quality requirements\n",
    "- Content creation that needs to meet style guidelines\n",
    "- Complex reasoning tasks that benefit from multiple passes\n",
    "- Translation work requires nuanced understanding\n",
