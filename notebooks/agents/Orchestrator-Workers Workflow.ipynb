    "# Orchestrator-Workers Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore the orchestrator-workers pattern — a powerful workflow design for creating flexible AI systems that can tackle complex, unpredictable tasks.\n",
    "Using Kotlin and Claude via LangChain4j,\n",
    "we'll implement a practical example that demonstrates\n",
    "how a main _\"orchestrator\"_ LLM can coordinate multiple _\"worker\"_ LLMs to achieve better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the orchestrator-workers pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "The orchestrator-workers pattern involves using a central LLM (the orchestrator) to analyze a complex task,\n",
    "break it down dynamically into subtasks, and then delegate these subtasks to specialized worker LLMs.\n",
    "Finally, the orchestrator synthesizes the results into a cohesive output.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Orchestrator-Workers Workflow Diagram](image/orchestrator_workers.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow differs from simple parallelization because:\n",
    "- The subtasks aren't predetermined but are identified dynamically by the orchestrator\n",
    "- The orchestrator can make decisions about task allocation based on the specific input\n",
    "- There's an explicit coordination layer that manages the overall process\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use this pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "- Software development tasks that involve changes across multiple files\n",
    "- Complex research or analysis requiring multiple perspectives\n",
    "- Content creation with varying style requirements\n",
    "- Multistep problem-solving with interdependent components\n",
    "\n",

The HydroEarth bottle stands apart from conventional alternatives through thoughtful design and genuine sustainability credentials.\n",
      "\n",
      "## How HydroEarth Compares to Conventional Bottles\n",
      "\n",
      "### Materials That Make a Difference\n",
      "While standard plastic water bottles are petroleum-based products requiring 700 years to decompose, the HydroEarth is crafted from plant-derived bioplastics and recycled stainless steel. This combination creates a product with 87% less carbon footprint than traditional bottles during manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Lifecycle Comparison\n",
      "Consider this: a person using disposable bottles consumes approximately 167 bottles annually. Over five years, that's 835 bottles in landfills or oceans. A single HydroEarth bottle replaces all of these, preventing approximately 30 pounds of plastic waste per person.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Toxin-Free Hydration\n",
      "Unlike many conventional plastic bottles containing BPA, phthalates, and microplastics that leach into your water, HydroEarth features a completely non-toxic interior that maintains water purity even after hundreds of uses and temperature changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Environmental Problems Solved\n",
      "\n",
      "The HydroEarth directly addresses three critical environmental challenges:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Petroleum Consumption**: Conventional plastic bottles consume 17 million barrels of oil annually just for U.S. demand. HydroEarth's bioplastic components derive from sustainable plant sources instead of fossil fuels.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Oceanic Plastic Pollution**: With 8 million metric tons of plastic entering our oceans yearly, HydroEarth prevents approximately 300 potential ocean-bound bottles per user over its lifetime.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Landfill Burden**: When your HydroEarth eventually reaches end-of-life, its components are 100% recyclable or compostable, unlike conventional bottles that remain in landfills for centuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Making Informed Choices\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding the true cost of conventional bottles extends beyond the purchase price. While a disposable water bottle might cost $1-2, the environmental price includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Water usage: 3 liters required to produce 1 liter of bottled water\n",
      "- Carbon emissions: 82.8g of CO₂ per disposable bottle\n",
      "- Waste management costs: $70 million annually in U.S. cleanup costs\n",
      "\n",
      "The HydroEarth's slightly higher upfront investment ($35) pays for itself within 3-4 weeks of daily use while eliminating these hidden environmental costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "By choosing HydroEarth, you're not just buying a water bottle—you're participating in a necessary shift toward sustainable consumption that our planet urgently needs.\n"

    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The orchestrator LLM receives the initial task and analyzes it to identify distinct approaches (like formal and conversational styles)\n",
    "2. Based on its analysis, the orchestrator dynamically generates subtasks with specific requirements\n",
    "3. Each subtask is delegated to a worker LLM, which executes it with the focused parameters\n",
    "4. The orchestrator collects the results from all workers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The orchestrator-workers pattern offers a powerful approach to building AI systems that can tackle complex, unpredictable tasks.\n",
    "By dynamically breaking down problems and delegating subtasks to specialized workers,\n",
    "we can create more flexible, adaptable solutions.\n",
