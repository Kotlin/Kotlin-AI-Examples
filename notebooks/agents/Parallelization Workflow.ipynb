    "\n",
    "Parallelization involves running multiple LLM tasks simultaneously and then combining their results.\n",

    "  Each LLM instance focuses on a specific aspect of the problem, allowing for more focused attention and often better results.\n",
    "- Voting — Running the same task multiple times with different prompts or configurations to gather diverse perspectives,\n",
