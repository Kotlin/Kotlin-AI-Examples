    "# Routing Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore the routing workflow pattern for building AI agents.\n",
    "Using Kotlin and OpenAI's GPT models via the LangChain4j library,\n",
    "we'll implement a practical example that demonstrates how to intelligently route different types of requests to specialized handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is routing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing is a workflow pattern that first classifies an input and then directs it to the most appropriate specialized handler.\n",
    "Think of it as a smart dispatcher that ensures each request is handled by the right expert.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Routing Workflow Diagram](image/routing.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each handler can be optimized for specific input types\n",
    "- Routing logic is isolated from processing logic\n",
    "- Specialized handlers perform better on their specific tasks\n",
    "- Adding new handlers is straightforward\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use routing\n",
    "\n",
    "Common use cases include:\n",
    "- Customer support ticket classification\n",
    "- Content moderation with different policies\n",
    "- Optimizing cost/performance by routing between different model sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up environment\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Verify Your Identity**: Before we proceed, we need to confirm your identity. Please provide the following information:\n",
      "   - The email address associated with your account.\n",
      "   - Any recent transactions or account activity that you can recall.\n",
      "   - The last successful login date and time.\n",

      "   - Go to the login page and click on \"Forgot Password?\"\n",
      "   - Enter your registered email address and follow the instructions sent to your email.\n",
      "   - Create a new password that is strong and unique (at least 12 characters, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Check for Account Lock**: If you have attempted to log in multiple times with an incorrect password, your account may be temporarily locked for security reasons. If this is the case, please wait 30 minutes before trying again or proceed with the password reset.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Once you regain access, we highly recommend enabling 2FA for added security. This will require a second form of verification when logging in, significantly enhancing your account's protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Security Tips**:\n",
      "- Avoid using the same password across multiple accounts.\n",
      "- Regularly update your passwords and use a password manager if necessary.\n",
      "- Be cautious of phishing attempts; always verify the source of any communication regarding your account.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Resolution Time**: Once we receive the required information, we aim to resolve your issue within 24 hours. However, if you choose to reset your password, you should be able to regain access immediately after completing the reset process.\n",

      "### Steps to Export Data to Excel:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Navigate to Your Project**: Start by opening the project from which you want to export data.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Access the Export Feature**: Look for the \"Export\" option, which is typically found in the project settings or under the \"More\" menu (represented by three dots or a gear icon).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Select Data Type**: You may have options to choose what type of data you want to export (e.g., tasks, milestones, or overall project data). Select the appropriate option based on your needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Choose Excel Format**: When prompted, select the Excel format for your export. This is usually labeled as \".xlsx\" or \"Excel\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Initiate Export**: Click on the \"Export\" button. Depending on the size of your project, this may take a moment. Once completed, a download link will be provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Download the File**: Click the link to download your Excel file, and you can then open it in Excel for further analysis or reporting.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example of Usage:\n",
      "For instance, if you are managing a project with multiple tasks and team members, exporting this data can help you create a comprehensive report for stakeholders. You can analyze task completion rates, resource allocation, and timelines directly in Excel.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Relevant Documentation:\n",
      "For more detailed instructions, please refer to our [Exporting Data Documentation](#). This section provides additional insights and troubleshooting tips if you encounter any issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Related Features:\n",
      "You might also find the **Data Filtering** feature helpful before exporting. This allows you to narrow down the data to only what you need, making your Excel file more manageable. Additionally, consider using **Dashboards** to visualize your project data before exporting, which can provide a clearer picture of your project’s status.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask. Happy exporting!\n",

    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation follows these steps:\n",
    "- Classification\n",
    "- Structured output\n",
    "- Specialized handling\n",
    "- Response generation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The routing workflow offers a powerful approach to handling diverse inputs effectively.\n",
    "By separating classification from specialized handling, we can build systems that are both flexible and highly optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is particularly valuable for applications dealing with a wide variety of user requests or content types,\n",
    "allowing each specialized component to focus on what it does best while maintaining a coherent overall experience."
