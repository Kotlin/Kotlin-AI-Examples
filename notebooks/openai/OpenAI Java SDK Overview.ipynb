       "Coroutines in Kotlin are a way to handle concurrency and asynchronous programming. They allow you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous, making it easier to read and maintain. Coroutines can be paused and resumed without blocking a thread, which enables you to perform long-running tasks, such as network requests or I/O operations, without freezing the user interface.\n",
       "\n",
       "Coroutines are built on top of existing threading models in Kotlin and provide a simple way to work with tasks that can take time to complete. They are lightweight compared to threads, enabling you to have many coroutines running simultaneously without much overhead.\n",
       "\n",
       "To use coroutines in Kotlin, you typically utilize the `kotlinx.coroutines` library, which provides a range of coroutine builders and tools to assist with asynchronous programming.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Basic Example of Coroutines\n",
       "\n",
       "Here’s a simple example demonstrating how to launch a coroutine in Kotlin:\n",
       "\n",
       "```kotlin\n",
       "import kotlinx.coroutines.*\n",
       "\n",
       "fun main() = runBlocking {\n",
       "    // This will run in the main thread\n",
       "    println(\"Starting coroutine...\")\n",
       "\n",
       "    launch {\n",
       "        // This will run in a new coroutine\n",
       "        delay(1000L) // Simulate a long-running task (1 second)\n",
       "        println(\"Coroutine has finished!\")\n",
       "    }\n",
       "\n",
       "    println(\"This will print immediately!\")\n",
       "    delay(2000L) // Give time for the coroutine to finish\n",
       "    println(\"End of main.\")\n",
       "}\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "### Explanation\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **`runBlocking { ... }`**: This is a coroutine builder that blocks the current thread while awaiting the completion of the coroutines within its scope. It is often used in main functions or tests.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **`launch { ... }`**: This function starts a new coroutine. The block of code inside `launch` runs concurrently with the code that follows it in the `runBlocking` scope.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **`delay(1000L)`**: This function suspends the coroutine for a specified time (1000 milliseconds in this case). It does not block the thread, allowing other coroutines or code to run.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Print statements**: The outputs will show the order of execution based on the non-blocking nature of coroutines. \n",
       "\n",
       "When you run this code, you'll see:\n",
       "\n",
       "```\n",
       "Starting coroutine...\n",
       "This will print immediately!\n",
       "Coroutine has finished!\n",
       "End of main.\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "This output demonstrates that the coroutine runs without blocking the main thread, where other code can continue executing."
