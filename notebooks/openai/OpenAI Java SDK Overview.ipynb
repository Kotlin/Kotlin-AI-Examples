       "Coroutines in Kotlin are a powerful feature that simplifies asynchronous programming and concurrency. They allow you to write non-blocking code in a sequential style, making it easier to work with asynchronous tasks without the complexity of traditional callback methods or thread management.\n",
       "\n",
       "Coroutines are lightweight threads that can be suspended and resumed, enabling you to perform long-running tasks without blocking the main thread. They are particularly useful for tasks like network calls, file I/O, or any operation that might take time and would otherwise cause your application to become unresponsive if handled on the main thread.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Concepts of Coroutines\n",
       "- **Suspend Functions**: Functions marked with the `suspend` keyword can be paused and resumed later. They can call other suspend functions, but they need to be called from within a coroutine or another suspend function.\n",
       "- **Coroutine Builders**: Functions that help create coroutines, such as `launch`, `async`, and `runBlocking`.\n",
       "- **Scope**: A coroutine scope defines a context for running coroutines. It manages the lifecycle of coroutines and provides a structure for launching them.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Example:\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a simple example demonstrating the use of coroutines in Kotlin. In this example, we'll simulate a network call that fetches data and update the UI accordingly.\n",
       "\n",
       "```kotlin\n",
       "import kotlinx.coroutines.*\n",
       "\n",
       "fun main() = runBlocking {\n",
       "    // Launching a coroutine\n",
       "    launch {\n",
       "        // Call a suspend function\n",
       "        val result = fetchDataFromNetwork()\n",
       "        println(\"Data fetched: $result\")\n",
       "    }\n",
       "\n",
       "    println(\"Coroutine launched, continuing with other work.\")\n",
       "}\n",
       "\n",
       "suspend fun fetchDataFromNetwork(): String {\n",
       "    // Simulating a long-running network call\n",
       "    delay(2000) // This is a suspend function\n",
       "    return \"Sample Data\"\n",
       "}\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "### Explanation of the Example:\n",
       "1. **`runBlocking { ... }`**: This is a coroutine builder that blocks the current thread until all the coroutines inside it complete. It's typically used in main functions or tests.\n",
       "   \n",
       "2. **`launch { ... }`**: This launches a new coroutine in the background. It doesn't block the current thread and returns immediately.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **`suspend fun fetchDataFromNetwork()`**: This function simulates fetching data from the network. The `delay` function is used here to mimic the time taken for a network call without blocking the thread.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **`delay(2000)`**: This is a suspending function that introduces a delay of 2 seconds. During this time, other coroutines or code can run without being blocked.\n",
       "\n",
       "When you run this program, it will print \"Coroutine launched, continuing with other work.\" almost immediately, followed by \"Data fetched: Sample Data\" after a 2-second delay, demonstrating the non-blocking behavior of coroutines."

The student (computer) learns from labeled examples—like showing a child pictures of cats and dogs and telling them which is which. In contrast, unsupervised learning is like letting a student explore without guidance. The student gets a pile of pictures but must find out patterns on their own, like grouping similar images without knowing what they are.\n",
